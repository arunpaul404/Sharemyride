# Sharemyride

In this current world, technology innovation is developing day by day which makes people's 
life easier and more comfortable. Nowadays, nearly every work of a computer and many 
features are presently empowered in a mobile application. To move in the city, it is quite 
expensive when people use transport privately but if it is possible to share, then the cost of 
transportation will decrease at least half or less than half. This paper presents an android 
application that works collectively using Google APIs and maps. This is a ride-sharing app. 
Users with the same destination will be able to share rides with others who are of the same 
place to reach. The application will calculate their fares. A database is used to store the 
records of registered users. By using the android-based platform, application would be 
optimized for any usage. For the applications, efficient offline and online algorithms have 
been presented. An algorithm with theoretical analysis and trace-driven simulations under 
practical settings has been verified

Need of the system:

Sharing a ride has numerous benefits such as reducing traffic congestion and
parking demands. Ridesharing also helps to eliminate vehicle emissions and creates less 
stressful commutes.Reduced traffic congestion– Ridesharing takes vehicles off the road, 
which means less congested roads.

The application works in real-time and 
matches car rides by comparing routes to find the common path. Unlike ride sharing 
websites, which has to be updated frequently by the users, does not contain interaction 
between them, and does not supply enough information about exact pickup or drop-off 
locations, and unlike other ride sharing mobile applications that find matches only 
according to the users’ origin and destination, in the above system there are updates at 
real time, exact locations based on GPS readings, interactions among the users, and 
algorithm that enables the system to locate and match the best suitable ride according to 
the users’ paths and coordinates along the way, which allows users to share just parts of 
their ride. This project demonstrates an algorithm that builds a new route from two given 
routes dynamically, step-by-step, with attention to the maximum preferred deviation from
the original route, and with error-correction when exceeding this limitation. We believe 
that with the growing attention to environmental issues, and as the density of 
transportation and parking places continue to increase, there will be a greater need and 
use in such algorithms, to the benefit of al
